# Excludr
Systematic Review Exclusion Tool

Excludr is an AI-powered tool designed to help researchers and scientists streamline the systematic review process by automatically excluding irrelevant papers based on predefined exclusion criteria.

## Features

- Suggested exclusions: Excludr uses machine learning algorithms to identify and exclude irrelevant papers from your search results.
- Customizable exclusion criteria: Define your own exclusion criteria using a simple and intuitive interface.
- Support for multiple languages: Excludr supports multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, and more.
- Integration with local LLM models: Excludr uses locally running LLM models to provide accurate and efficient exclusion results.

## How it works

- Import: Import you RIS files with search results into a project to start excluding irrelevant papers.
- Exclusion criteria: Define your exclusion criteria using a simple and intuitive interface.
- Exclusion: Excludr's AI-powered algorithm will suggest exclusions for irrelevant papers based on your predefined criteria.
- Results: View the filtered search results, including the excluded papers.

### Requirements

TODO: Update requirements setup

Local LLM model: Excludr requires a locally running LLM model to function. You can use pre-trained models or train your own.

### Installation

- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/fromej/excludr.git
- Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Download and install the LLM model: follow the instructions in the models directory
